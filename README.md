# Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction

**Overview**

This project aims to predict whether a hotel reservation will be canceled. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze historical booking data and identify key factors influencing cancellation decisions.

**Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The dataset was thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical features. EDA techniques were employed to gain insights into the data, including:

* **Data Cleaning:** Removing inconsistencies and errors.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features that might be predictive.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing data distributions and relationships.

**Model Development**

A Random Forest Classifier was selected as the primary model for this task. The model was trained on the preprocessed data, with a key modification: **the threshold was set to 0.265 instead of the traditional 0.5**. This adjustment was made to prioritize the prediction of cancellations, even if the model's confidence was relatively low. 

**Model Evaluation**

The model's performance was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The achieved AUC-ROC score of 0.894 indicates strong predictive power.

**Deployment**

The trained model was deployed as a web application using Flask and Docker. This allows for easy deployment and accessibility.

**Key Contributions**

* **Innovative Thresholding:** The use of a non-standard threshold to optimize cancellation prediction.
* **Robust Model Selection:** The choice of Random Forest as a suitable algorithm for this classification task.
* **Effective Deployment:** The successful deployment of the model as a web application.

**Future Work**

Potential future improvements to this project include:

* **Incorporating Time Series Analysis:** Analyzing seasonal trends and patterns in cancellation rates.
* **Experimenting with Deep Learning:** Exploring the potential of neural networks for more complex feature extraction.
* **Enhancing Feature Engineering:** Developing more sophisticated feature engineering techniques to capture additional insights.

## Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction**

### **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a hotel reservation will be canceled. By accurately predicting cancellations, hotels can optimize their operations and improve revenue management.

### **Data and Features**

The dataset consists of 16 features related to hotel reservations, including:

* **Booking-related features:** 'number of adults', 'number of children',
       'number of weekend nights', 'number of week nights', 'type of meal',
       'car parking space', 'room type', 'lead time', 'market segment type',
       'repeated', 'P-not-C', 'average price ', 'special requests', month, day, year

The target variable is the `booking_status`, indicating whether a reservation was canceled or not.

### **Model Selection and Training**

A Random Forest classifier was chosen as the primary model due to its ability to handle complex interactions between features and its robustness to overfitting. 

**Key Optimization:**
To prioritize the identification of potential cancellations, a custom threshold of 0.265 was employed during model training. This threshold allows for a higher sensitivity to cancellations, enabling proactive measures to be taken.

### **Evaluation**

The model's performance was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). An AUC-ROC score of 0.894 was achieved, indicating strong predictive power.

### **Deployment**

The trained model was deployed as a Flask API and containerized using Docker. This enables easy integration into hotel management systems and facilitates scalability and deployment flexibility.

### **Future Work**

Potential areas for future improvement include:

* **Feature Engineering:** Exploring additional features and feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
* **Model Ensembling:** Combining multiple models to further improve predictive accuracy.
* **Real-Time Predictions:** Integrating the model into a real-time system to provide timely insights.
* **Explainable AI:** Developing techniques to interpret the model's decisions and gain insights into the underlying reasons for predictions.

By continuously refining and updating the model, hotels can make more informed decisions and optimize their operations.
