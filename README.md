## **README: Hotel Reservation Cancellation Prediction**

### **Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a hotel reservation will be canceled. By accurately predicting cancellations, hotels can optimize their operations and improve revenue management.

### **Data and Features**

The dataset consists of 16 features related to hotel reservations, including:

* **Booking-related features:** 'number of adults', 'number of children',
       'number of weekend nights', 'number of week nights', 'type of meal',
       'car parking space', 'room type', 'lead time', 'market segment type',
       'repeated', 'P-not-C', 'average price ', 'special requests', month, day, year

The target variable is the `booking_status`, indicating whether a reservation was canceled or not.

### **Model Selection and Training**

A Random Forest classifier was chosen as the primary model due to its ability to handle complex interactions between features and its robustness to overfitting. 

**Key Optimization:**
To prioritize the identification of potential cancellations, a custom threshold of 0.265 was employed during model training. This threshold allows for a higher sensitivity to cancellations, enabling proactive measures to be taken.

### **Evaluation**

The model's performance was evaluated using the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). An AUC-ROC score of 0.894 was achieved, indicating strong predictive power.

### **Deployment**

The trained model was deployed as a Flask API and containerized using Docker. This enables easy integration into hotel management systems and facilitates scalability and deployment flexibility.

### **Future Work**

Potential areas for future improvement include:

* **Feature Engineering:** Exploring additional features and feature engineering techniques to enhance model performance.
* **Model Ensembling:** Combining multiple models to further improve predictive accuracy.
* **Real-Time Predictions:** Integrating the model into a real-time system to provide timely insights.
* **Explainable AI:** Developing techniques to interpret the model's decisions and gain insights into the underlying reasons for predictions.

By continuously refining and updating the model, hotels can make more informed decisions and optimize their operations.
